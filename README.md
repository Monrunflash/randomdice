This program is created to evaluate the randomness of random method. My interest is to know the effectiveness of the method because machines can't create truly random numbers.

The program throw a 6-sided Die and calculate the frequency of each one.

After reach 0.01 diference between the maximum and the minimum percentage it creates a graphic showing the proportion of each number (1,2,3,4,5,6) and also it creates 3 vertical lines when the diference reach 1%, 0.1% and 0.01%.

The more dices it throws the less diferences between sides. Almost reaching 0%.
